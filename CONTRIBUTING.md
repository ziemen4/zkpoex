First off, thank you for considering contributing! We welcome contributions of all kinds, from bug reports to documentation improvements and new features. Please take a moment to review this guide to ensure a smooth contribution process.

## 1. How to Contribute

1. **Check existing issues:** Before opening a new issue, search the issue tracker to see if someone else has already reported the bug or suggested the feature.
2. **Pick up an issue:** Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`. Feel free to comment that you are working on it to avoid duplication of effort.
3. **Open a Pull Request:** Go to the original repository and open a PR, if an issue is not already open. Make sure to reference the issue number in your PR description.

## 2. Reporting Bugs

When filing a bug report, please include:

- A clear and descriptive title.

We strive to keep the issue tracker organized:

- **Milestones:** Larger goals may be grouped under milestones. Check milestones for high-level project plans.
- **Pull Request References:** If your PR addresses one or more issues, reference them in the PR description (e.g., `Fixes #123`).
