# zkpoex

**zkpoex** is a Rust-based toolkit for proving exploits using zero-knowledge proofs. Built on top of [risc0](https://risc0.com/), zkpoex leverages advanced cryptographic techniques to verify exploit execution without revealing sensitive details. The project is structured as a Cargo workspace with four main members: **host**, **methods**, **evm-runner** and **sc-owner**.

## Features

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** Use risc0 to generate verifiable zk proofs of exploit execution.
- **EVM Integration:** Interact with an Ethereum Virtual Machine interpreter for proving.
- **Modular Design:** Workspace split into multiple packages for clear separation of concerns.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Rust Toolchain:** Install the latest version from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).
- **solc (Solidity Compiler):** Required for compiling smart contracts. Install by following the instructions on [Solidity Docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/installing-solidity.html).
- **solc-select:** A tool to quickly switch between Solidity compiler versions. Install via [solc-select repository](https://github.com/crytic/solc-select).
- **Just:** A command runner to streamline common tasks. Install via [Justfile instructions](https://github.com/casey/just).
- **Risc0 SDK:** Follow the installation instructions on [risc0 Docs](https://dev.risczero.com/api/zkvm/install).
- **Foundry:** Install Foundry by following the instructions on [Foundry repository](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry).

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/zkpoex.git
   cd zkpoex
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure you have the Rust toolchain and solc installed. Then, update your Rust dependencies:

   ```sh
   cargo update
   ```

3. **Build the Foundry project**

   This will compile the Solidity contracts and prepare the project for proper operation.

   ```sh
   cd contracts && forge build
   ```

---

## Setup & Build

The project is configured as a Cargo workspace.

**The** current configuration ensures optimized builds for faster execution of proofs.

---

## Usage

### Prover

#### Proving an Exploit

To generate a zero-knowledge proof of an exploit, you can run:

```sh
just prove
```

For more details on running the prove logic, check out the [`host/README.md`](./host/README.md).

**Important**: Beware since the prover has very high requirements

---

#### Compiling Contracts

Contracts are written in Solidity. Use the provided `justfile` commands to compile them:

```sh
just compile-contract
```

---

#### Running Tests for the EVM Runner

After compiling contracts, you can run the tests for the `evm-runner` package:

```sh
just test-evm
```

---

### Smart contract owner

#### Verifier Deployment

To deploy a verifier contract, create context_state and program_spec for your project and then deploy. Example:

```bash
just deploy-verifier "./shared/examples/basic-vulnerable/context_state.json" "./shared/examples/basic-vulnerable/program_spec.json" "testnet" "500000000000000000"
```
